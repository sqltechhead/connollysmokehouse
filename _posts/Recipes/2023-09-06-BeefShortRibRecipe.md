## Meat
1. Rub the dry rub into the ribs generously on both sides. Leave for the flavour to bed in for an hour minimum or overnight.
2. Get your BBQ/Smoker to 110C and get set up with your choice of wood and coal.
3. Place the ribs in the smoker and smoke for 3 hours.
4. Take the ribs out and put them in foil
5. Add beef stock to the foil to cover the bottom. This will help flavour and tenderize.
6. Fold the foil up and close around the liquid and the ribs. Ensure no rips.
7. Put back in the smoker for 2 hours at 110C again.
8. Take ribs out of foil and put back into the smoker, they should be getting really tender now.
9. Mop with your mop sauce. 
10. Repeat mopping every 30 minutes for another 3 hours or until the internal temperature meets 98Celcius
11. Rest for 30 minutes to an hour and then serve
