## Ingredients
- [ ] 200g dark chocolate
- [ ] 200g unsalted butter
- [ ] 300g light brown sugar
- [ ] 100g plain flour
- [ ] 50g cocoa powder
- [ ] 4 Eggs
- [ ] 300g Chocolate Chunks (I use white chocolate chunks and buttons)

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 160 Celcius 
2. Melt the dark chocolate and unsalted butter in a saucepan together
3. While that is melting, mix the sugar, flour and cocoa powder in a seperate bowl.
4. Take off the heat when melted and mix the wet with the dry ingredients
5. Crack the eggs in a seperate bowl and whisk
6. Mix the eggs in with the mixture and mix until combined
7. Line a square 7" tray
8. Now quickly pour in the chocolate chunks and mix. You need to do it quickly so it doesn't melt and keeps that chunky consistency
9. Finally get the tray into the oven and cook for 25-30 minutes. You want the mix not wobbly but still wet with a skewer in the middle
10. Let the tray cool slightly for 15 minutes then put in the fridge overnight or freezer for 4 hours
11. After that time it should be good to cut and enjoy
