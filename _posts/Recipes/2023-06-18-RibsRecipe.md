4. Take the ribs out and put in foil
5. Add 4 tbsp of Apple Juice in with the foil. This will help flavour and tenderize.
6. Fold the foil up and close around the liquid and the ribs. Ensure no rips.
7. Put back in the smoker for 3 hours at 110C again.
8. Take ribs out of foil and put back into the smoker, they should be getting really tender now.
