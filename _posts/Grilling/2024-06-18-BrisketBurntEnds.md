## Ingredients

- [ ] [BrisketRub]({% link _posts/Rubs/2023-09-24-BrisketRub.md %})

### BBQ Sauce
- [ ] [DRPepperBBQSauce]({% link _posts/Rubs/2024-06-18-DRPepperBBQSauce.md %})

### Foil Wrap
- [ ] 2tbsp Butter
- [ ] 2tbsp Brown Sugar


## Method
1. Trim the brisket of any excess fat. Its always good to leave an even layer on one side, this will add flavour to the meat. But too much fat will make it taste too fatty so be careful
2. Combine all the rub together and then rub it all over the meat. Leave for at least an hour, preferably overnight.
3. Get the smoker to about 110 Celcius
4. Place the brisket on fat side down
5. Cook for 3 hours
6. Setup foil out flat big enough for wrapping the brisket and place the butter and sugar on the foil
7. Take the brisket out of the smoker and place it with the fat side pointing upwards
8. Put a temperature probe in the meat and place it back on the smoker. Set an alert for 90 Celcius
9. Test the meat after the temperature hits 90 usually 2 hours ish. Test to your liking of softness
10. Once happy take off the smoker and put in a cool box and rest for 30 minutes
11. Slice and enjoy
