Smoking is the process of adding flavour to meat by burning various different types of wood. Its an ancient technique and one that is growing in popularity at the moment. 

Now i had only really cooked with a gas BBQ, i had used charcoal BBQs when i was young, but those times would usually be squirting a load of lighter fluid onto it and creating a huge mess. Being older and wiser i realize the errors of my ways, and thinking back on those tainted burgers i must have cooked make me feel very uneasy. 

Now if you're like me, who wants to get into smoking however you don't want to shed out a load of money before you've really learnt enough to warrant that investment, you may think what can i do? You can actually very easily get started with smoking by using a normal charcoal barrel BBQ. The main point of smoking is to cook your food low and slow to really take on that flavour, so all you need to do is ensure youre barell bbq can be kept at a low temperature for a long enough time. In comes Direct vs Indirect Heat.
