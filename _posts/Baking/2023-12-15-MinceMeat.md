## Ingredients
- [ ] 400g Dried Mixed Fruit
- [ ] 175g Suet (beef)
- [ ] 225g Dark Brown Sugar
- [ ] 1/2 Teaspoon Nutmeg
- [ ] 2 Teaspoons Mixed Spice
- [ ] 1 Lemon Grated Zest and Juiced
- [ ] 1 Orange Grated Zest and Juiced
- [ ] 1 Cooking Apple
- [ ] 4 TableSpoons of Brandy 

## Method
1. In a large roomy baking bowl, combine all the ingredients except the brandy.
2.  Stir well making sure they are all evenly distributed. Cover with a clean towel and leave overnight for the flavours to melt together.
3. Next day heat the oven to 110g Celcius
4. Remove the tea towel and cover the bowl with foil and place in the warmed oven for 1 1/2 hours. At the end of this time, the suet will have melted but don't worry, this is how it should be. The fat is what will help to preserve the mincemeat as well as giving lots of flavors. Stir the mincemeat mixture well and leave to one side to cool, stirring from time to time. The stirring is essential as it helps to distribute the fruits evenly as the mixture cools.
5. Once cooled stir the mincemeat again, add the brandy and stir one more time.
6. Fill previously sterilized large 500g jars with the cold mincemeat. Put on the lid and store in a cool dark place.
