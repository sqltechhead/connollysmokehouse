## Ingredients
- [ ] 600g strong white bread flour,
- [ ] 1.5 tsp salt
- [ ] 2 tsp Dried Yeast
- [ ] 2 tbsp Caster Sugar
- [ ] 100g Unsalted Butter
- [ ] 2 Eggs
- [ ] 50ml Warm Milk
- [ ] 225 Warm Water
- [ ] Sesame Seeds
	

## Method
1. Mix the flour, salt, yeast and sugar in a mixing bowl. 
2. Rub in the butter until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs.
3. Add the mixture to an electric mixer
4. Add the egg and milk and turn on mixer
5. Once dough has come together finish off by kneading on a surface until shiny
6. Leave to rise for 2 hours
7. Knock the air out of the dough and then shape into balls. Weigh them out 100g each
8. Leave in a proving box (or covered with cling film) for another hour to rise.
9. At 30 minutes turn the oven onto 180 Celcius. Add an empty pan in the oven. We will add boiling water to this before we cook the buns to create steam and create a soft outer bun. 
10. Put the buns on a baking sheet and glaze with beaten egg and a little water. If you are adding sesame seeds then add it now. 
11. Bake for 20 minutes until golden
