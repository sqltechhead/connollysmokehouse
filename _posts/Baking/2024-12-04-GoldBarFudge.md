## Ingredients
- [ ] 397g Tin Condensed Milk
- [ ] 600g White Chocolate
- [ ] 2tsp Vanilla Extract
- [ ] 14 Gold Bars

## Method
- Line a 24cm Square tin with baking paper
- Put the condensed milk, white chocolate and vanilla extract in a saucepan and heat slowly
- Once all combined take off the heat
- Cut up half of the gold bars and mix with the mixture
- Spoon into the tin and flatten
- Decide how many slices you want from the mix and push a gold bar or half a gold bar whatever you like into those rough slices. This way when you cut you'll have a nice solid bit of gold bar to present.
