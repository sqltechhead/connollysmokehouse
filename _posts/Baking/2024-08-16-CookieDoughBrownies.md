## Ingredients
### Brownie
- [ ] 200g dark chocolate
- [ ] 200g unsalted butter
- [ ] 250g light brown sugar
- [ ] 100g plain flour
- [ ] 50g cocoa powder
- [ ] 4 Eggs
- [ ] 150g Chocolate Chunks (I use white chocolate chunks and buttons)

### Cookie Dough
- [ ] 125g Unsalted Butter
- [ ] 150g Light Brown Sugar
- [ ] 175g Plain flour
- [ ] 1tsp Vanilla Extract
- [ ] Milk to bind 

## Method
### Cookie Dough
1. Mix the butter and sugar together until combined
2. Add the flour and vanilla extract and mix again
3. Add a tbsp of milk at a time until sufficiently combined, you want to be able to ball it up cleanly.
4. Chunk up the cookie dough, you want 1 or 2 pieces per slice. Set aside.

### Brownies
1. Preheat the oven to 160 Celcius 
2. Melt the dark chocolate and unsalted butter in a saucepan together
3. While that is melting, mix the sugar, flour and cocoa powder in a seperate bowl.
4. Take off the heat when melted and mix the wet with the dry ingredients
5. Crack the eggs in a seperate bowl and whisk
6. Mix the eggs in with the mixture and mix until combined
7. Line a square 7" tray
8. Now quickly pour in the chocolate chunks and mix. You need to do it quickly so it doesn't melt and keeps that chunky consistency
9. Now add your cookie dough chunks
10. Finally get the tray into the oven and cook for 25-30 minutes. You want the mix not wobbly but still wet with a skewer in the middle
11. Let the tray cool slightly for 15 minutes then put in the fridge overnight or freezer for 4 hours
12. After that time it should be good to cut and enjoy
