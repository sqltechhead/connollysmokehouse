### Butter Cream	
- [ ] 285g Softened Butter
- [ ] 575g Icing Sugar
- [ ] 4tbsp Milk

## Method
### Cake
1. Mix the margarine with the sugar until combined.
2. Add in the eggs and self raising flour a little at a time to ensure no curdling.
3. Add the vanilla extract, baking powder and milk and mix again.
4. Finally add in your choice of food coloring.
5. You can make either of the below, so line and grease your tins accordingly. 
   * 1 - 4 tier - 9 inch cake
   * 2 - 3 tier - 7 inch cakes
6. Fill the tins with the mixture.
7. Bake for 25 minutes. They will be done once a skewer comes out clean.
8. Once cooked allow to cool for 15 minutes then remove and let cool on a wired rack. 
9. Once fully cool, wrap each tier in cling film and put in the fridge.

> Putting the cakes in the fridge will firm them up, making them easier to ice.

### Filling
1. Whisk the butter for 3 minutes by itself. This combines the butter better so it can be mixed easier with the sugar.
2. Sieve the icing sugar then add gradually to the butter
3. Add the milk to the mixture to thin it out a little then mix one last time.

### Assembling
1. Put the first layer onto a cake board.
2. Spread a thin layer of butter cream on top.
3. Place the next layer on and ensure they align. 
4. Repeat the butter cream and layer process until your tiers are used up.
5. Now you want to do what is known as a crumb coat on the top and the sides of the cake. This is a really thin layer over the entire cake. This just locks all the crumbs into the cake, meaning you won't have any in your mixture. Put it back in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up again
6. Now at this stage you can colour your icing if you are doing so. 
7. Spread the icing over the sides and top of your cake and smooth using a cake smoother
8. Once your cake is to your liking its ready to add any final touches you plan. 

> Using a piping bag and piping around the cake can sometimes be alot easier, but you may waste butter cream,
