## Ingredients
- [ ] [1 large 500g jar mincemeat](https://grillingandbrewing.co.uk/posts/MinceMeat/)
- [ ] 375g plain flour
- [ ] 260g unsalted butter, softened
- [ ] 125g caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] Milk for glazing
- [ ] 12 Mince Pie Foil Dishes

## Method

1. Place 375g plain flour and 260g softened unsalted butter in a bowl and rub together to a crumb consistency.
2. Add 125g caster sugar and 1 large beaten egg, and mix together.
3. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and fold until the pastry comes together, be careful not to over mix.
4. Wrap the pastry in cling film and chill for 10 mins.
5. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan
6. Roll out the pastry to 3mm thick.
7. Put the foil dishes into a muffin tray
8. Using a round cutter (about 10cm), cut out 16 bases and place them in the foil dishes. Put 1Â½ tbsp mincemeat mixture into each. Brush the edge of each pie with a little milk.
9. Re-roll out the pastry to cut 7cm lids and press them on top to seal. Glaze with the milk, sprinkle with the extra caster sugar, then make a small cut in the tops.
10. Bake the mince pies for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool before releasing them from the muffin trays and dusting with a little more icing sugar before serving.
