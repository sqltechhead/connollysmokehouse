## Introduction
Theres a lot to do on Christmas day, lots of plates to spin. Even if you're just cooking for a small amount of people, prepping as much as possible ahead of the day will let you to be stress free and spend more time with family on the day. 

Another tip is to make sure you have your timings documented and printed so you can follow them on the big day. Here i will run through my plan for the day including the prep and the recipes for each.

|Honey Glazed Carrot and Parsnips|Par boil the veg and coat in the glaze. Store in a foil dish covered in the fridge|
